# Haskell: Mastering Pure Functional Programming

Haskell stands as one of the most elegant and mathematically rigorous programming languages ever created. Named after the logician Haskell Curry, this purely functional language has influenced countless other languages and continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in software development. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to expand your paradigm or a curious programmer drawn to mathematical beauty in code, Haskell offers a transformative programming experience.

## What Makes Haskell Special?

### Pure Functional Programming

Haskell is **purely functional**, meaning functions have no side effects by default. A function with the same input will always produce the same output, making programs predictable and easier to reason about.

```haskell
-- Pure function - always returns the same result for the same input
square :: Int -> Int
square x = x * x

-- This will always be True
isAlwaysTrue = square 5 == square 5
```

### Immutability by Default

In Haskell, values are immutable by default. Once created, they cannot be changed. This eliminates entire classes of bugs related to unexpected mutations.

```haskell
-- Values are immutable
originalList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubledList = map (* 2) originalList
-- originalList is still [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
-- doubledList is [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

-- No variable reassignment
x = 10
-- x = 20  -- This would be a compile-time error!
```

### Lazy Evaluation

Haskell uses lazy evaluation, meaning expressions are only computed when their results are actually needed. This enables elegant solutions to problems that would be difficult in strict languages.

```haskell
-- Infinite list - only computed as needed
infiniteOnes :: [Int]
infiniteOnes = 1 : infiniteOnes

-- Take first 5 elements (perfectly safe!)
firstFive = take 5 infiniteOnes  -- [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

-- Fibonacci sequence as infinite list
fibs :: [Integer]
fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)

-- Get 10th Fibonacci number
fib10 = fibs !! 10  -- 55
```

### Strong Static Type System

Haskell's type system is both powerful and expressive, catching errors at compile time while requiring minimal type annotations thanks to type inference.

```haskell
-- Type inference - Haskell figures out the types
add x y = x + y  -- Inferred: Num a => a -> a -> a

-- Explicit type signatures (recommended for top-level functions)
factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

-- Algebraic data types
data Shape = Circle Float | Rectangle Float Float

area :: Shape -> Float
area (Circle r) = pi * r^2
area (Rectangle w h) = w * h
```

## Getting Started with Haskell

### Installation and Setup

The easiest way to get started with Haskell is through GHCup, the Haskell toolchain installer:

```bash
# Install GHCup (on Unix-like systems)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://get-ghcup.haskell.org | sh

# This installs:
# - GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
# - Cabal (package manager)
# - Stack (build tool)
# - HLS (Haskell Language Server)

# Start the interactive interpreter
ghci

# Or create a new project
cabal init my-haskell-project
cd my-haskell-project
```

### Your First Haskell Program

Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" and build from there:

```haskell
-- Main.hs
module Main where

main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, Haskell!"

-- Compile and run
-- $ ghc Main.hs
-- $ ./Main
```

Now let's explore some fundamental concepts:

```haskell
-- Function definition
greet :: String -> String
greet name = "Hello, " ++ name ++ "!"

-- Pattern matching
describeList :: [a] -> String
describeList [] = "Empty list"
describeList [x] = "Single element list"
describeList [x, y] = "Two element list"
describeList _ = "Longer list"

-- Guards (like if-else chains)
bmi :: Float -> Float -> String
bmi weight height
  | bmi' <= 18.5 = "Underweight"
  | bmi' <= 25.0 = "Normal"
  | bmi' <= 30.0 = "Overweight"
  | otherwise    = "Obese"
  where bmi' = weight / height^2
```

## Core Concepts and Patterns

### Higher-Order Functions

Functions are first-class citizens in Haskell. You can pass them as arguments, return them from other functions, and store them in data structures.

```haskell
-- Map applies a function to each element
doubled = map (* 2) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  -- [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

-- Filter keeps elements that satisfy a predicate
evens = filter even [1..10]  -- [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

-- Fold reduces a list to a single value
sum' = foldl (+) 0 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  -- 15
product' = foldr (*) 1 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  -- 120

-- Function composition
-- (.) composes functions: (f . g) x = f (g x)
squareAndDouble = (* 2) . (^ 2)
result = squareAndDouble 5  -- 50 (5^2 * 2)

-- Creating higher-order functions
applyTwice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
applyTwice f x = f (f x)

-- Usage
eight = applyTwice (* 2) 2  -- 8
```

### Algebraic Data Types

Haskell's type system allows you to create sophisticated data structures that precisely model your domain.

```haskell
-- Simple enumeration
data Color = Red | Green | Blue
  deriving (Show, Eq)

-- Product types (records)
data Person = Person
  { name :: String
  , age :: Int
  , email :: String
  } deriving (Show)

-- Sum types (tagged unions)
data Vehicle
  = Car String Int        -- brand, year
  | Bicycle String        -- brand
  | Boat String Float     -- name, length
  deriving (Show)

-- Recursive data types
data Tree a
  = Empty
  | Node a (Tree a) (Tree a)
  deriving (Show)

-- Binary search tree insertion
insert :: (Ord a) => a -> Tree a -> Tree a
insert x Empty = Node x Empty Empty
insert x (Node a left right)
  | x == a = Node x left right
  | x < a  = Node a (insert x left) right
  | x > a  = Node a left (insert x right)
```

### Maybe and Either: Handling Failure Safely

Haskell doesn't have null pointers. Instead, it uses `Maybe` and `Either` to handle potentially missing values and errors.

```haskell
-- Maybe for values that might not exist
safeDivide :: Float -> Float -> Maybe Float
safeDivide _ 0 = Nothing
safeDivide x y = Just (x / y)

-- Using Maybe
result1 = safeDivide 10 2   -- Just 5.0
result2 = safeDivide 10 0   -- Nothing

-- Chain operations with Maybe
safeCalculation :: Float -> Float -> Maybe Float
safeCalculation x y = do
  div1 <- safeDivide x y
  div2 <- safeDivide div1 2
  return (div2 + 1)

-- Either for values that can fail with an error message
safeRead :: String -> Either String Int
safeRead s = case reads s of
  [(n, "")] -> Right n
  _         -> Left ("Cannot parse " ++ s ++ " as Int")

-- Using Either
parseAndDouble :: String -> Either String Int
parseAndDouble s = do
  n <- safeRead s
  return (n * 2)
```

### List Comprehensions

Haskell's list comprehensions provide a concise way to create and transform lists.

```haskell
-- Basic list comprehension
squares = [x^2 | x <- [1..10]]  -- [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

-- With conditions
evenSquares = [x^2 | x <- [1..10], even x]  -- [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]

-- Multiple generators
pairs = [(x, y) | x <- [1, 2, 3], y <- ['a', 'b']]
-- [(1,'a'), (1,'b'), (2,'a'), (2,'b'), (3,'a'), (3,'b')]

-- Pythagorean triples
pythagorean n = [(a, b, c) | c <- [1..n],
                            b <- [1..c],
                            a <- [1..b],
                            a^2 + b^2 == c^2]
```

## Advanced Features

### Type Classes

Type classes define interfaces that types can implement, providing a form of ad-hoc polymorphism.

```haskell
-- Defining a type class
class Describable a where
  describe :: a -> String

-- Implementing the type class
instance Describable Person where
  describe p = name p ++ " (" ++ show (age p) ++ " years old)"

instance Describable Vehicle where
  describe (Car brand year) = show year ++ " " ++ brand
  describe (Bicycle brand) = brand ++ " bicycle"
  describe (Boat name length) = name ++ " (" ++ show length ++ "ft boat)"

-- Common type classes
-- Eq: equality comparison
-- Ord: ordering
-- Show: converting to string
-- Read: parsing from string
-- Num: numeric operations

-- Using type class constraints
maximum' :: (Ord a) => [a] -> a
maximum' [] = error "Empty list"
maximum' [x] = x
maximum' (x:xs) = max x (maximum' xs)
```

### Functors, Applicatives, and Monads

These are fundamental abstractions in Haskell for dealing with computational contexts.

```haskell
-- Functor: things that can be mapped over
-- fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

-- Lists are functors
doubled = fmap (* 2) [1, 2, 3, 4]  -- [2, 4, 6, 8]

-- Maybe is a functor
maybeDouble = fmap (* 2) (Just 5)   -- Just 10
nothingDouble = fmap (* 2) Nothing  -- Nothing

-- Applicative: functors that can apply functions
-- (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

-- Applying functions in context
add3 :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
add3 x y z = x + y + z

result = pure add3 <*> Just 1 <*> Just 2 <*> Just 3  -- Just 6

-- Monad: computations that can be sequenced
-- (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b

-- Maybe monad for chaining computations that might fail
lookupAge :: String -> [(String, Int)] -> Maybe Int
lookupAge name db = lookup name db

lookupEmail :: String -> [(String, String)] -> Maybe String
lookupEmail name db = lookup name db

getUserInfo :: String -> [(String, Int)] -> [(String, String)] -> Maybe (Int, String)
getUserInfo name ageDB emailDB = do
  age <- lookupAge name ageDB
  email <- lookupEmail name emailDB
  return (age, email)
```

### IO and Side Effects

Haskell keeps side effects separate from pure computations using the IO monad.

```haskell
-- Simple IO operations
greetUser :: IO ()
greetUser = do
  putStr "What's your name? "
  name <- getLine
  putStrLn ("Hello, " ++ name ++ "!")

-- File operations
copyFile :: FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()
copyFile source dest = do
  contents <- readFile source
  writeFile dest contents
  putStrLn ("Copied " ++ source ++ " to " ++ dest)

-- Error handling with IO
safeReadFile :: FilePath -> IO (Either String String)
safeReadFile path = do
  result <- try (readFile path)
  case result of
    Left ex -> return (Left (show ex))
    Right contents -> return (Right contents)

-- Combining pure and impure code
processFile :: (String -> String) -> FilePath -> FilePath -> IO ()
processFile transform input output = do
  contents <- readFile input
  let processed = transform contents  -- Pure computation
  writeFile output processed
  putStrLn "File processed successfully"
```

## Real-World Applications

### Web Development with Servant

Servant is a popular Haskell library for building type-safe web APIs:

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}
{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}

import Servant
import GHC.Generics

-- Data types
data User = User
  { userId :: Int
  , userName :: String
  , userEmail :: String
  } deriving (Eq, Show, Generic)

instance ToJSON User
instance FromJSON User

-- API specification
type UserAPI = "users" :> Get '[JSON] [User]
          :<|> "users" :> Capture "userid" Int :> Get '[JSON] User
          :<|> "users" :> ReqBody '[JSON] User :> Post '[JSON] User

-- Implementation
userAPI :: Proxy UserAPI
userAPI = Proxy

server :: Server UserAPI
server = getUsers :<|> getUser :<|> postUser

getUsers :: Handler [User]
getUsers = return [User 1 "Alice" "alice@example.com"]

getUser :: Int -> Handler User
getUser uid = return (User uid "Bob" "bob@example.com")

postUser :: User -> Handler User
postUser user = return user
```

### Parsing with Parsec

Haskell excels at creating parsers thanks to its powerful parsing libraries:

```haskell
import Text.Parsec
import Text.Parsec.String (Parser)

-- Simple expression parser
data Expr = Num Int | Add Expr Expr | Mul Expr Expr
  deriving (Show)

number :: Parser Expr
number = do
  n <- read <$> many1 digit
  return (Num n)

term :: Parser Expr
term = number <|> between (char '(') (char ')') expr

factor :: Parser Expr
factor = do
  t <- term
  rest t
  where
    rest t = (do char '*'
                 t' <- term
                 rest (Mul t t'))
             <|> return t

expr :: Parser Expr
expr = do
  f <- factor
  rest f
  where
    rest f = (do char '+'
                 f' <- factor
                 rest (Add f f'))
             <|> return f

-- Usage
parseExpr :: String -> Either ParseError Expr
parseExpr = parse expr ""
```

### Concurrent Programming with STM

Software Transactional Memory makes concurrent programming safer:

```haskell
import Control.Concurrent.STM
import Control.Concurrent.Async

-- Shared state
type Account = TVar Int

-- Transfer money between accounts atomically
transfer :: Account -> Account -> Int -> STM ()
transfer from to amount = do
  fromBalance <- readTVar from
  if fromBalance >= amount
    then do
      writeTVar from (fromBalance - amount)
      toBalance <- readTVar to
      writeTVar to (toBalance + amount)
    else retry  -- Transaction fails, retry

-- Concurrent transfers
concurrentTransfers :: IO ()
concurrentTransfers = do
  account1 <- newTVarIO 1000
  account2 <- newTVarIO 500

  -- Run transfers concurrently
  async1 <- async $ atomically $ transfer account1 account2 200
  async2 <- async $ atomically $ transfer account2 account1 100

  wait async1
  wait async2

  balance1 <- readTVarIO account1
  balance2 <- readTVarIO account2

  putStrLn $ "Account 1: " ++ show balance1
  putStrLn $ "Account 2: " ++ show balance2
```

## Performance Considerations

### Profiling and Optimization

Haskell provides excellent profiling tools:

```bash
# Compile with profiling enabled
ghc -prof -fprof-auto -rtsopts Main.hs

# Run with profiling
./Main +RTS -p

# Generate detailed heap profile
./Main +RTS -h
hp2ps -c Main.hp
```

### Strict Evaluation

Sometimes lazy evaluation can cause space leaks. Haskell provides strict evaluation when needed:

```haskell
import Data.List (foldl')

-- Strict left fold to avoid space leaks
sumList :: [Int] -> Int
sumList = foldl' (+) 0

-- Bang patterns for strict evaluation
data StrictPair a b = StrictPair !a !b

-- Seq forces evaluation
forceEvaluation :: [Int] -> IO ()
forceEvaluation xs = do
  let result = sum xs
  result `seq` putStrLn ("Sum: " ++ show result)
```

## Testing in Haskell

### Property-Based Testing with QuickCheck

QuickCheck automatically generates test cases to verify properties:

```haskell
import Test.QuickCheck

-- Property: reverse is its own inverse
prop_reverseInverse :: [Int] -> Bool
prop_reverseInverse xs = reverse (reverse xs) == xs

-- Property: length is preserved by reverse
prop_reverseLength :: [Int] -> Bool
prop_reverseLength xs = length (reverse xs) == length xs

-- Property: sorted list remains sorted after insertion
prop_insertSorted :: Int -> [Int] -> Property
prop_insertSorted x xs =
  isSorted xs ==> isSorted (insert x xs)
  where
    isSorted [] = True
    isSorted [_] = True
    isSorted (a:b:rest) = a <= b && isSorted (b:rest)

-- Run tests
main :: IO ()
main = do
  quickCheck prop_reverseInverse
  quickCheck prop_reverseLength
  quickCheck prop_insertSorted
```
