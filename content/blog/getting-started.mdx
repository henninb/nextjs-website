# Getting Started with NextJS and TypeScript

NextJS and TypeScript create a powerful combination for building modern web applications. In this guide, I'll walk you through setting up a new project and explain some of the key benefits.

## Why NextJS?

NextJS offers several advantages over a standard React application:

- **Server-side rendering** for better performance and SEO
- **Static site generation** for blazing-fast page loads
- **API routes** to build backend functionality without a separate service
- **File-based routing** that simplifies navigation setup

## Setting Up Your Environment

First, make sure you have Node.js installed (version 14 or later recommended). Then run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-project --typescript
cd my-project
npm run dev
```

This will create a new NextJS project with TypeScript support and start the development server.

## Adding TypeScript Types

One of the biggest advantages of TypeScript is static typing. Here's a simple example:

```typescript
// Without TypeScript
function addNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// With TypeScript
function addNumbers(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

The TypeScript version ensures that only numbers are passed to the function and that it returns a number.

## Next Steps

In future posts, I'll cover:

1. Adding a component library
2. Setting up authentication
3. Connecting to APIs
4. Deployment strategies
